# EX 03 Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for image classification and to verify the response for new images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

Include the Problem Statement and Dataset.The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset. The FashionMNIST dataset contains grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories (e.g., T-shirt, trousers, dress, etc.), and the model aims to classify them correctly. The challenge is to achieve high accuracy while ensuring computational efficiency.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Define the goal of classifying fashion apparel items into 10 categories using a CNN. Ensure high accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

### STEP 2:
Use the FashionMNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of clothing items. Each image is 28Ã—28 grayscale and labeled with one of 10 classes.

### STEP 3:
Convert images to tensors and normalize pixel values to [0,1]. Use DataLoaders for efficient batch processing during training and testing.

### STEP 4:
Design a CNN with convolutional layers for feature extraction, ReLU activation, pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for classification

### STEP 5:
Train the CNN using CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer for multiple epochs. Monitor accuracy and loss to ensure proper learning.

### STEP 6:
Test the model on unseen FashionMNIST data, compute performance metrics, and analyze using a confusion matrix.

### STEP 7;
Save the trained model for future use and visualize predictions on sample test images. Optionally, integrate into an application for real-world use.

```python
class CNNClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNNClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=32, out_channels=64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=64, out_channels=128, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(128 * 3 * 3, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv3(x)))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1) #Flatten the image
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

```

```python
# Initialize model, loss function, and optimizer
model = CNNClassifier()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

```

```python
# Train the Model
def train_model(model, train_loader, num_epochs=3):
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        model.train()
        running_loss = 0.0
        for images, labels in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(images)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            running_loss += loss.item()

        print('Name: THARUN V K        ')
        print('Register Number: 212223230231     ')
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {running_loss/len(train_loader):.4f}')
